V. PRODUCT CARE
CARE BY MATERIAL

Product care details:

* Knitted fabric: after washing, lay flat to dry to avoid stretching.

* Voile, silk, chiffon should be hand washed.

* Plain, twill, khaki fabric without decorations or beads can be machine washed.

* Plain, twill, khaki fabric with contrasting colors or decorated with voile, silk, beads should be hand washed.

* Jeans should be washed by hand as much as possible to avoid fading. If machine washing, turn the product inside out, button up, zip up, and do not wash with light-colored clothes to avoid color transfer.

CARE FOR FORM/SHAPE

1. Use alternately:
    – A very important note to preserve your product is to use it on alternate days or rotate usage.
    – If used continuously without rest, it will quickly lose its shape.
    – The time hanging on a hanger is when the suit regains its form.
    – Also, if you don't have time to clean, don't throw it in the dirty laundry basket, hang it in a well-ventilated place to avoid moisture and keep it dry and clean.

2. Do not put too many items in jacket/pant pockets:
    – Putting many items in pockets (inside or outside jacket, or pants) not only ruins the lines of the outfit but over time will also destroy the form, stretching the pocket seams.
    – If you are wearing a fitted suit, it is best to only carry essentials like cash, phone, and credit card.

3. Clean quickly with a soft brush or lint roller to remove debris and dust from the suit before washing:
     – This is the best way to prolong the life of natural fibers and the fabric of the garment.

4. Absolutely do not wash with water at home or use a washing machine to ensure the form and quality of the product.

5. Hang up after use:
    – Choose hangers with round and thick shoulders for shirts and suits (preferably specialized hangers) to maintain the form and create ventilation.
    – Always fold the product neatly into a clean garment bag when not in use.

6. Steam the product:
    – Dry irons are too hot and can burn high-end soft fabrics.
    – It is best to use a steamer to smooth the surface of the garment, as steam will expand the fibers and prevent strange odors, while also helping to remove small stains.

CARE FOR COLOR

* Products should be washed immediately, not soaked, to avoid color bleeding. Separate colors and fabric types to avoid color transfer. Do not wash with strong detergents, use diluted detergent.

* Products that can be machine washed should be set to gentle wash, medium spin, and sort by color and fabric type.

* Dry products in a cool, ventilated place, avoid direct sunlight to prevent fading. Air-drying in windy places helps preserve color.

* For 100% cotton fabrics, do not hang with hangers but lay flat on a clothesline to avoid fabric cracking.

* When ironing, use steam mode to make ironing easier, cooler, and prevent burning, keeping the color beautiful and durable. Iron temperature depends on the fabric type.
